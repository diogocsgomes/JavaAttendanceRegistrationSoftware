 <b>Important Notes: </b><br>

  MainServer, Client and BackUpServer should all have the following respective configurations
  <li>5001 1099 database-backup "sqlite"</li>
  <li>5001 localhost</li>
  <li>path to temp file ex: "C:/Users/.../.../temp"</li>
  <li>Someting.txt file in directory temp should be deleted before running the BackUpServer</li>
  <li>Client credentials(it is possible to register new client accounts in the client app): <br> 
  username: client@test password:1234</li>
  <li>Admin credentials(it is only possible to add an admin through the sql file, an BD managment software like DataGrip does the trick): <br> 
  username: admin@test password: 1234</li>
</ul>
